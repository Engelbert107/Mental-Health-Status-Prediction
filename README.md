# Mental Health Status Prediction using NLP


This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze text and classify it into seven mental health statuses:
Normal, Depression, Suicidal, Anxiety, Stress, Bi-Polar, Personality Disorder.

By developing an AI-powered system, users can input their thoughts and receive a predicted mental health status. The goal is to aid early detection, awareness, and mental health insights.
